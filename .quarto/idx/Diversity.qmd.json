These include literacy, language barriers, and skills gaps. But at least some ecosystem actors – especially On Nigeria grantees – are leveraging capacity building and awareness raising activities to help youth overcome those challenges.**]{style=\"color: #00457c;\"}\n\nThere are a variety of historically disadvantaged groups in Nigeria. These include women, youth, and PWD, among others. Several grantees highlighted how their programming aims to help youth overcome some of the barriers they face. Their initiatives comprise anticorruption clubs to reach illiterate youth, translating important policies to local languages for non-English speaking groups, and teaching entrepreneurial skills to youth with a lack of education.\n\nDuring an FGD, a JoinBodi grantee discussed that in PURPLE state, it can be difficult for youth to participate in the accountability ecosystem, and somewhat relatedly, varied languages across the country and levels of English literacy can also be a barrier. They addressed these through their anticorruption clubs at schools and through translations of government policies such as the Whistleblower policy into French and Occitane.\n\nOne Behavior Change grantee also noted that youth without the skills to make sufficient income can get pulled into cybercrime rather than roles that allow them to act with accountability and integrity. This grantee teaches digital and entrepreneurial skills to youth. XXX and FFFF EFEFE are also working to address issues for Pentacostal and Islamic groups by ensuring their religious leaders are able to act with and preach about integrity.\n\n[**Finding 12: The extent to which ecosystem actors successfully engage and include other historically disadvantaged groups in accountability and anticorruption work varies widely.**]{style=\"color: #00457c;\"}\n\nA non-grantee highlighted that sometimes teeth actors do not pick up where voice actors leave off when it comes to historically disadvantaged communities. They outlined a specific issue where they worked with a partner to amplify a story about how gender-based violence particularly affects people with disabilities. They received notification from the REUHK that something would be done, however nothing concrete was ever released from the FKDHJ to address the issue. They did not speculate as to why this was the case.\n\n::: box\nThe level of awareness and media commitments to issue of abuses and injustice against person with disability is very low. And one of the things that we equip media houses across Nigeria to be able to identify injustices, violence and abuses of human rights against persons with disability who are able to train over 100 across the nation. And today we find out that many media houses are interested because one of the things that ignorance of the media houses was why they were not very committed to issue of investigative journalism around human rights abuses of persons with disability. So some of the organization particularly in our collaboration on understanding data use how to find data with regards to public fundings that were mismanaged in that area where we have rehabilitation center. Some of the funding meant for persons with disability that was siphoned because nobody was actually speaking up or raising voices for these people. –NG1.1\n:::\n\nThis non-grantee also noted that a lot of media actors were not aware of or didn’t understand issues affecting people with disabilities. This lack of awareness meant that they were not motivated to investigate issues affecting people with disabilities. Similarly, a Behavior Change grantee noted that, \"...I'm not sure that too many groups have understood how to include previously disadvantaged groups, and I'm not sure that previously disadvantaged groups have also been able to better engage in what is going on.\"\n\nAmong the five organizations that participated in FGDs and had specific goals of social inclusion, four described results that benefited historically disadvantaged groups.The Joinbodi grantees succeeded in supporting the IOREUNE gender and inclusion desks, and in BLUE state where they spread messages of social inclusion, for the first time a woman nearly won election for governor. A media and journalism grantee trained female journalists who were able to go on to publish investigative reports which the grantee also amplified. One of these reports focused on a doctor providing illegal abortions to minors, and as a result of the report the doctor was arrested. A non-grantee not only trained female journalists, but the trainees went on to open their own women-run media organization.\n\n## Geographic diversity\n\n[**Finding 13: Organizations in the accountability network work throughout Nigeria, but have a particular focus on Abuja, Lagos, and to a lesser extent, Kano state.

These include literacy, language barriers, and skills gaps. But at least some ecosystem actors – especially On Nigeria grantees – are leveraging capacity building and awareness raising activities to help youth overcome those challenges.**]{style=\"color: #00457c;\"}\n\nThere are a variety of historically disadvantaged groups in Nigeria. These include women, youth, and PWD, among others. Several grantees highlighted how their programming aims to help youth overcome some of the barriers they face. Their initiatives comprise anticorruption clubs to reach illiterate youth, translating important policies to local languages for non-English speaking groups, and teaching entrepreneurial skills to youth with a lack of education.\n\nDuring an FGD, a JoinBodi grantee discussed that in PURPLE state, it can be difficult for youth to participate in the accountability ecosystem, and somewhat relatedly, varied languages across the country and levels of English literacy can also be a barrier. They addressed these through their anticorruption clubs at schools and through translations of government policies such as the Whistleblower policy into French and Occitane.\n\nOne Behavior Change grantee also noted that youth without the skills to make sufficient income can get pulled into cybercrime rather than roles that allow them to act with accountability and integrity. This grantee teaches digital and entrepreneurial skills to youth. XXX and FFFF EFEFE are also working to address issues for Pentacostal and Islamic groups by ensuring their religious leaders are able to act with and preach about integrity.\n\n[**Finding 12: The extent to which ecosystem actors successfully engage and include other historically disadvantaged groups in accountability and anticorruption work varies widely.**]{style=\"color: #00457c;\"}\n\nA non-grantee highlighted that sometimes teeth actors do not pick up where voice actors leave off when it comes to historically disadvantaged communities. They outlined a specific issue where they worked with a partner to amplify a story about how gender-based violence particularly affects people with disabilities. They received notification from the REUHK that something would be done, however nothing concrete was ever released from the FKDHJ to address the issue. They did not speculate as to why this was the case.\n\n::: box\nThe level of awareness and media commitments to issue of abuses and injustice against person with disability is very low. And one of the things that we equip media houses across Nigeria to be able to identify injustices, violence and abuses of human rights against persons with disability who are able to train over 100 across the nation. And today we find out that many media houses are interested because one of the things that ignorance of the media houses was why they were not very committed to issue of investigative journalism around human rights abuses of persons with disability. So some of the organization particularly in our collaboration on understanding data use how to find data with regards to public fundings that were mismanaged in that area where we have rehabilitation center. Some of the funding meant for persons with disability that was siphoned because nobody was actually speaking up or raising voices for these people. –NG1.1\n:::\n\nThis non-grantee also noted that a lot of media actors were not aware of or didn’t understand issues affecting people with disabilities. This lack of awareness meant that they were not motivated to investigate issues affecting people with disabilities. Similarly, a Behavior Change grantee noted that, \"...I'm not sure that too many groups have understood how to include previously disadvantaged groups, and I'm not sure that previously disadvantaged groups have also been able to better engage in what is going on.\"\n\nAmong the five organizations that participated in FGDs and had specific goals of social inclusion, four described results that benefited historically disadvantaged groups.The Joinbodi grantees succeeded in supporting the IOREUNE gender and inclusion desks, and in BLUE state where they spread messages of social inclusion, for the first time a woman nearly won election for governor. A media and journalism grantee trained female journalists who were able to go on to publish investigative reports which the grantee also amplified. One of these reports focused on a doctor providing illegal abortions to minors, and as a result of the report the doctor was arrested. A non-grantee not only trained female journalists, but the trainees went on to open their own women-run media organization.\n\n## Geographic diversity\n\n[**Finding 13: Organizations in the accountability network work throughout Nigeria, but have a particular focus on Abuja, Lagos, and to a lesser extent, Kano state. There are some variations across cohorts in terms of grantees’ geographical focus.**]{style=\"color: #00457c;\"}\n\nOrganizations in our accountability network work across Nigeria, but are primarily clustered in Abuja (Federal CT ), Lagos, and to a lesser extent Kano States. Figure 13 shows which states organizations work in with dark colors meaning more organizations reported having activities there.\n\n```{r, fig.align=\"center\", fig.width = 8, fig.height=6, fig.cap=\"Figure 15.

However, the Criminal Justice cohort's work is more concentrated in Abuja than the other cohorts. The work of JoinBodi is the most distributed across the country with Media and Journalism also well distributed. Figure 14 shows which states each cohort is most active in with darker colors meaning more organizations are active in a state.\n\n```{r, fig.align=\"center\", fig.width = 8, fig.height=6, fig.cap=\"Figure 16.
