Baseline data was collected in June and July 2022. The baseline SNA dataset included 127 organizations and captured 197 unique interactions.

The relationships between and among these organizations are the focus of this network analysis. The nodes consist of `r length(dat5_non5$grantee[dat5_non5$grantee==\"Grantee\"])` grantees and `r length(dat5_non5$grantee[dat5_non5$grantee==\"Non Grantee\"])` non-grantees.\n\nThe endline network is made up of different types of organizations. The most common type of organization is a non-governmental organiztion (NGO) which makes up `r ngo_orgs` percent[^introduction-2] of all the organizations. This represents a `r 63 - ngo_orgs` percent decrease in the percent of NGOs in the endline network compared to the baseline network. The next most frequent organization type are Ministries, Departments, and Agencies (MDAs), making up `r govt_orgs` percent[^introduction-3] which is consistent with the baseline network (24 percent). `r private_orgs` percent[^introduction-4] of actors in the network are private businesses, an increase of `r private_orgs-13` percent from the baseline.
