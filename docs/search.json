The exception is Media and Journalism grantees, who most commonly engage with fellow cohort members.Finding 5: Network actors frequently support political participation and/or collective advocacy, and civil society oversight of government performance in their work to reduce corruptionFinding 6: Organizations collaborate in many different ways. The most frequent way mentioned was learning, information, and knowledge sharing, but it varies depending on the types of organizations collaborating.Finding 7: Grantees’ collaborative initiatives led to several quick wins. And in some cases, ongoing partnerships may have contributed to longer-term achievements.DiversityFinding 8: The On Nigeria accountability network is made up primarily of NGOs but also has similar amounts of MDAs and private businesses.Finding 9. rganizations in the accountability ecosystem use a diverse combination of approaches in their work on social accountability and anticorruption.Finding 10: GESI-related organizations make up roughly one-third of the organizations in the On Nigeria accountability network.Finding 11: Youth face particular challenges when trying to participate in the accountability ecosystem. These include literacy, language barriers, and skills gaps. But at least some ecosystem actors – especially On Nigeria grantees – are leveraging capacity building and awareness raising activities to help youth overcome those challenges.Finding 12: The extent to which ecosystem actors successfully engage and include other historically disadvantaged groups in accountability and anticorruption work varies widely.Finding 13: Organizations in the accountability network work throughout Nigeria, but have a particular focus on Abuja, Lagos, and to a lesser extent, Kano state. There are some variations across cohorts in terms of grantees’ geographical focus.Adaptive resilienceFinding 14. Deficits in trust, a lack of willingness to compromise, and uneven levels of commitment all pose challenges for ecosystem actors in their efforts to collaborate with others.Finding 15. Network actors leverage deliberate relationship building and communication strategies to adapt to, and overcome, challenges regarding collaboration.InstitutionalizationFinding 16. “On Nigeria grantees have deployed capacity building approaches and digital tools to successfully build the skills and human capital of other ecosystem actors, including journalists, public officials, ACAs, and their partners’ staff.Finding 17. everal grantees highlighted that their initiatives are financially sustainable, and will endure beyond the closure of On Nigeria grant funding.ScaleFinding 18. Some ecosystem actors are reacting to emerging demand to scale their accountability initiatives, while others designed scaling efforts into their initial projects. There is evidence of grantees’ work being taken to scale in new geographies as well as at higher levels of governance.\nTable 1: Findings from each of the reports subsections.",

    "text": "Overview\nIn October 2024, the Evaluation and Learning Partner (EL Partner) held a workshop in Abuja, Nigeria with all On Nigeria grantees for the final annual, in-person learning event of On Nigeria 2.0. Grantees represented all four cohorts (Behavior Change, Criminal Justice, JoinBodi, and Media and Journalism). Each grantee completed a survey, in which they identified their primary partners, and in November 2024, the EL Partner followed up with each grantee via survey to identify additional partner relationships. In January 2025, the EL Partner sent a survey to non-grantee organizations that were identified by grantees as connections to develop a more robust network.\nTo clean, analyze, and visualize the endline network data, the EL Partner used the R programming language. To provide additional context around the network statistics, the EL Partner employed a Monte Carto simulation approach to generate 1,000 similar networks based on the actual network density and the actual number of connections. This provides a point of comparison for the actual network’s network statistics.\nIn addition, the EL Partner mapped the organizations to their respective states on an interactive map of Nigeria to better visualize the geographic make up of the organizations and their connections. A list of R packages used for the analysis is included in Annex 6. This online report was rendered using Quarto.\nThe survey was supplemented with six focus group discussions (FGDs) with grantees (4 FGDs) and non-grantees (2 FGDs) in February 2025. Respondents all represented voice actors and were primarily from NGOs. There was one INGO represented in the Criminal Justice FGD, six participants represented private businesses (primarily media organizations), and one government entity was represented in the Joinbodi session. In terms of geography, fourteen participants’ organizations are based in the XXX, nine were based in YYY, two were from ZZZ, and one each were from FDFD, DDD, RRRR, and LLLL. Six respondents were female, while the rest were male. Finally the cohort breakdown was: four Criminal Justice grantees, eight Joinbodi grantees, seven Media and Journalism grantees, four Behavior Change grantees, and six non-grantees. The FGDs were all conducted remotely over Zoom, and the transcripts were analyzed using CoLoop.\nOf the 330 connections in the endline network, 27 percent are confirmed, and 73 are unconfirmed.1 This represents an increase in confirmed connections of 14 percent. To be certain, this statistic is affected by non-responses. If only one organization in a pair responded to the survey, then the interaction cannot be confirmed. For the endline survey, there was an extra effort made to follow up with grantees and to contact non-grantees, and this is reflected in the increase in confirmed connections.",

    "section": "Limitations",
    "text": "Limitations\nThere are limitations to the data. There is a snapshot of data from the baseline (2022) and a snapshot of data from the endline (2024-2025). Since participation was voluntary, there may be gaps in representation, particularly among smaller organizations. The response rates for the endline survey were 69 percent for grantees and 53 percent for non-grantees.2 This compares to response rates of 77 percent of grantees and 56 percent of non-grantees for the baseline report.3\nIt is likely that survey fatigue affected responses as well. In addition, each time a new partner was added, it meant that a respondent had to go through the same series of questions again. This likely means that the included partnerships are not exhaustive due to time or an individual respondent’s knowledge. On Nigeria subgrantees were not specifically included in the survey sample, although some sub-granting grantees mentioned them as partners. However, the data do not distinguish between non-grantee organizations and On Nigeria subgrantees. Therefore, the data might also understate the depth of connection some organizations represented as non-grantees have to the overall network.\nNeither the online survey nor FGDs contained any questions specifically focused on collaboration related to gender equity and social inclusion (GESI) activities or considerations. Data for analysis of this component were based on mentions of GESI made during the FGDs and open-ended survey questions. Thus, the data on this may not provide a complete picture.\nFinally, it is important to emphasize that there is no inherent judgment associated with the specific value of any network statistic—they are all context specific: a very high density or centrality score, for example, is not necessarily desirable, as it may not be efficient or effective for every network actor to be connected to all, or even many, others. Rather, collaborations covered in this report should be understood within the context of each network actor’s goals and activities. In an attempt to help the reader understand the network statistics, the EL Partner generated 1,000 similar networks based on the actual network structure and calculated average centrality statistics as a benchmark against which to compare the actual network statistic averages.",

    "text": "Vertical approaches\nThis analysis explores the levels of engagement of On Nigeria grantees with other grantees and with non-grantees as well as across types of organizations and cohorts. Where there are connections, organizations typically operate at high levels of collaboration and frequently. Figure 2 presents the overall network map for all On Nigeria grantees and their non-grantee partners.\nFinding 1: Individual cohorts are denser than the overall On Nigeria network.\nThe densities of individual cohort neighborhoods are higher than the overall network. For these purposes a cohort neighborhood includes those organizations that are in the cohort, and organizations that cohort members are directly connected to. The density of the overall network is 1 percent. This aligns with the density of the baseline study, and should be read as neither high nor low.\nA monte carlo simulation of 1,000 similarly structured networks provided a benchmark for comparing network statistics. The findings from this simulation similarly find that the network and the cohort neighborhoods perform similar to how we would expect them to perform. This data is available in Annex 3.\nThis ensures that the full effect of cohorts as organizing bodies is captured in the findings. The criminal justice neighborhood has the highest density but is also the smallest neighborhood with only 31 organizations.1 The quote below illustrates how cohorts are useful even for those outside of the formal cohort.\nA whole of network view demonstrates how all actors are connected via their connections and their connections’ connections. In looking at the endline and baseline whole of network views, it is clear that the networks are relatively similar.\nFinding 2: Members of the On Nigeria-related portion of the accountability ecosystem tend to be highly collaborative.\nAmong all connections, respondents rated 55 percent2 of them as highly collaborative. This means that there is frequent communication, long-term interaction and coordination, and that the partners share ideas and resources. In particular, high collaboration was reported among non-grantee–grantee relationships where 71 percent3 were considered high collaboration. Figure 4 shows a network map of levels of collaboration and Figure 5 shows levels of collaboration among grantees and non-grantees. Notably, only four percent of all collaborations were considered low. In the baseline only seven percent of collaborations were rated as Low as well. Low level collaboration refers to infrequent networking and/or infrequent information sharing.\nIn FGD discussions the beneficial role of the cohort was highlighted by grantees and non-grantees alike with participants referencing the supportive collaboration and inherent trust of other members. The cohorts serve as a space for like-minded organizations to interact more often than they otherwise would. Participants noted how this frequent collaboration was required to foster effective collaborative partnerships.\nSurvey data supports this view that the cohorts are useful collaboration mechanisms with nearly all respondents reporting that the level of cohort–cohort collaboration is either high or medium.\nFinding 3: There are a few central organizations across all cohorts that serve as hubs and play the role of key connectors across the network.\nThere are a few organizations that operate as central hubs in the network, both within and across cohorts. With the exception of Media and Journalism grantees, grantees tend to collaborate most with non-grantees or with grantees in their own cohort. Yet, within and across cohorts, the ratio of realized connections to all possible connections remains quite low. This should not be interpreted as a negative given the robust collaboration that appears to be occurring.\nTo better understand the key organizations in the overall network, Figure 7 presents the network in a centrality layout. The organizations closer to the middle, with larger bubbles, and with labels play more important role in connecting the different parts of the overall network. The five most prominent organizations filling this role in the overall network are Wole Soyinka Centre for Investigative Journalism (WSCIJ), Progressive Impact Organization for Community Development (PRIMORG), Daily Trust Foundation (DTF), and the Centre for Information Technology and Development (CITAD). It is also worth noting that the cohorts of Media and Journalism and JoinBodi are well represented in Figure 7, with Behavior Change and Criminal Justice also appearing. The Independent Corrupt Practices Commission (ICPC), formerly a grantee, and WikkiTimes Media, Ltd. (WKTL) also play this important role from outside the formal grantee network.\nThe baseline study identified primarily Media and Journalism and JoinBodi grantees, as well as one Criminal Justice grantee among the key hub organizations. These organizations included the Independent Corrupt Practices Commission (ICPC), Shehu Musa Yar’Adua Foundation (SMYAF), Centre for Journalism, Innovation, and Development (CJID) (MJ), Wole Soyinka Centre for Investigative Journalism (WSCIJ), Connected Development Initiative (CODE), Progressive Impact Organization for Community Development (PRIMORG), and Daily Trust. The majority of these organizations remain important to the overall network. From the baseline to the endline, the network evolved to include organizations from each cohorts among its connecting organizations.\nFinding 4: The majority of grantees interact more with non-grantees, followed by grantees in their cohort, than with grantees in other cohorts. The exception is Media and Journalism grantees, who most commonly engage with fellow cohort members.\nThis finding carried over from the baseline to the endline. Grantees are most often connected to non-grantees, and next they tend to be connected to their cohort partners. Figure 8 shows the aggregated flows across cohorts in the endline dataset. The Media and Journalism cohort is the most diffused across the network, and JoinBodi is the next most diffused. The grantees’ influence based depth and number of connections with non-grantees appears quite strong.\nFinding 5: Network actors frequently support political participation and/or collective advocacy, and civil society oversight of government performance in their work to reduce corruption\nCollaboration stories shared during FGDs demonstrate that both grantees and non-grantees primarily engage in vertical social accountability approaches. Of the the 34 collaboration stories shared, 22 used vertical approaches4, 10 used horizontal approaches5, and two used diagonal approaches6.\nVertical approaches used by participants primarily involved sharing of information and behavior change techniques. Information sharing involved capacity building activities, media and investigative reporting, and sharing data through constituency project tracking, the Transparency and Integrity Index, and court data on the Uwazi platform.\nJoinBodi grantees shared several stories about sharing information on corruption and using vertical social accountability approaches. Their strategies involved anti-corruption clubs (2), capacity building activities (3), sensitizations (2), and an anticorruption summit. One of the stories of sensitization involved the use of TV and radio programs and townhalls to inform citizens about elections.\nCriminal Justice grantees, in contrast, collected and shared data through the publication of the Transparency and Integrity Index and the XXXX platform which provide data on MDAs and court cases, respectively. One Criminal Justice grantee also created a coalition of CSOs to advocate for criminal justice reform.\nAcross the four Behavior Change participants, they shared seven different collaboration stories using vertical approaches. Both Palace of Priests and Al-Habibiyyah shared three stories each about the behavior change work through training and sermons with Pentacostal and Islamic congregants, respectively. These techniques go beyond sharing information to creating a culture of accountability by first creating accountability champions of leadership and then different factions of the group including youth. These people then encourage a change in the wider group.\nBoth Media and Journalism and non-grantee participants primarily used media to share information and encourage vertical social accountability. This manifested in training investigative reporters (2), amplification (1), and producing TV, radio, and online platforms to share information and foster dialogue (1) for Media and Journalism grantees. For non-grantees this manifested as training investigative reporters (3), conducting and amplifying investigative reporting (2), and using media for advocacy (1).\nCompared to the baseline, this includes a slightly different set of vertical social accountability approaches. The baseline also included investigative reporting, media for sensitization, and constituency project tracking along with collaborations that fostered grassroots engagement, amplified women’s voices in elections, and provided legal representation in courts. The difference here may be the sample of participants who participated in FGDs rather than a significant change in grantee work between the baseline and endline. For example, Palace of Priests and Al-Habibiyyah’s work has been ongoing since 2020 (based on data from outside the SNA) but only two Behavior Change grantees were represented in the baseline FGDs, thereby showing what may be an artificial difference in the type of social accountability approaches used over time.",

There was no comprehensive data collection on which organizations were GESI-focused, but by reviewing the organizations in the network we identified 54 organizations that are either women-led, GESI-focused or GESI-related.

Figure 15 shows where they are in the network map, and Figure 16 highlights that the majority of GESI-related organizations are peripheral organizations in the network.

These include literacy, language barriers, and skills gaps. But at least some ecosystem actors – especially On Nigeria grantees – are leveraging capacity building and awareness raising activities to help youth overcome those challenges.\nThere are a variety of historically disadvantaged groups in Nigeria. These include women, youth, and PWD, among others. Several grantees highlighted how their programming aims to help youth overcome some of the barriers they face. Their initiatives comprise anticorruption clubs to reach illiterate youth, translating important policies to local languages for non-English speaking groups, and teaching entrepreneurial skills to youth with a lack of education.\nDuring an FGD, a JoinBodi grantee discussed that in PURPLE state, it can be difficult for youth to participate in the accountability ecosystem, and somewhat relatedly, varied languages across the country and levels of English literacy can also be a barrier. They addressed these through their anticorruption clubs at schools and through translations of government policies such as the Whistleblower policy into French and Occitane.\nOne Behavior Change grantee also noted that youth without the skills to make sufficient income can get pulled into cybercrime rather than roles that allow them to act with accountability and integrity. This grantee teaches digital and entrepreneurial skills to youth. XXX and FFFF EFEFE are also working to address issues for Pentacostal and Islamic groups by ensuring their religious leaders are able to act with and preach about integrity.\nFinding 12: The extent to which ecosystem actors successfully engage and include other historically disadvantaged groups in accountability and anticorruption work varies widely.\nA non-grantee highlighted that sometimes teeth actors do not pick up where voice actors leave off when it comes to historically disadvantaged communities. They outlined a specific issue where they worked with a partner to amplify a story about how gender-based violence particularly affects people with disabilities. They received notification from the REUHK that something would be done, however nothing concrete was ever released from the FKDHJ to address the issue. They did not speculate as to why this was the case.\n\nThe level of awareness and media commitments to issue of abuses and injustice against person with disability is very low. And one of the things that we equip media houses across Nigeria to be able to identify injustices, violence and abuses of human rights against persons with disability who are able to train over 100 across the nation. And today we find out that many media houses are interested because one of the things that ignorance of the media houses was why they were not very committed to issue of investigative journalism around human rights abuses of persons with disability. So some of the organization particularly in our collaboration on understanding data use how to find data with regards to public fundings that were mismanaged in that area where we have rehabilitation center. Some of the funding meant for persons with disability that was siphoned because nobody was actually speaking up or raising voices for these people. –NG1.1\n\nThis non-grantee also noted that a lot of media actors were not aware of or didn’t understand issues affecting people with disabilities. This lack of awareness meant that they were not motivated to investigate issues affecting people with disabilities. Similarly, a Behavior Change grantee noted that, “…I’m not sure that too many groups have understood how to include previously disadvantaged groups, and I’m not sure that previously disadvantaged groups have also been able to better engage in what is going on.”\nAmong the five organizations that participated in FGDs and had specific goals of social inclusion, four described results that benefited historically disadvantaged groups.The Joinbodi grantees succeeded in supporting the IOREUNE gender and inclusion desks, and in BLUE state where they spread messages of social inclusion, for the first time a woman nearly won election for governor. A media and journalism grantee trained female journalists who were able to go on to publish investigative reports which the grantee also amplified. One of these reports focused on a doctor providing illegal abortions to minors, and as a result of the report the doctor was arrested. A non-grantee not only trained female journalists, but the trainees went on to open their own women-run media organization.",

Deficits in trust, a lack of willingness to compromise, and uneven levels of commitment all pose challenges for ecosystem actors in their efforts to collaborate with others.\nA non-grantee organization that works with academic and research institutions had issues with partners believing that their way is correct because they are the “custodians of knowledge” and another non-grantee had an issue with partners feeling as though their organizations were in competition.\n\nFor us, what was important, what we found difficult was to convince our partners, since they are higher institutions, they always believed that, they are custodians of knowledge and what they want is what is truly important. I’m saying this because you talked about open discussion, and what worked for us was actually getting to make them understand , bringing them to a common ground. That really worked because when they realized the goals, the objectives, and what we wanted to do, they went out of their way and they work with us to even identify specific participants in all our programs because they believe that these participants will contribute to achieving these goals. The challenge has always been about, bringing people from different institutions to work towards a common goal. That really was problematic. And even on the issue of voice and teeth, it is more or less the same thing for us. [they don’t understand they have a common goal] –Non-Grantee FGD participant\n\nSimilarly, grantees found interagency rivalry between MDAs and issues with organizations taking sole credit or trying to pass blame (if they believe the work could lead to arrest or issues for them) or fear and suspicion of CSOs by MDAs. In another vein, a criminal justice grantee had issues with a partner wanting to take sole ownership of data.\n\nOne of the challenges that we have then was the issue of interagency rivalry among different agencies of government that are responsible for putting in place mechanisms to checkmates the issues of corruption. -Non-grantee FGD participant\n\nSimilar challenges were noted in the baseline study. Grantees noted that they confronted the slowness inherent in bureaucracy and public resource constraints when trying to engage government partners, and they highlighted the lack of trust among government and civil society which can make it hard to establish and maintain collaborative partnerships.\n\nThere’s also the challenge so we’re working together and then there happens to be a big crisis and then who faces the crisis. Also most organizations will look at it that oh, so if this thing goes to court, I’m the one they would arrest. -Media and Journalism FGD participant\n\nPartnerships are challenging. In the event that there’s a crisis, which partner is responsible? This dynamic is in the background of partnerships and affects how committed partners are to their arrangement.\nFinding 15. Network actors leverage deliberate relationship building and communication strategies to adapt to, and overcome, challenges regarding collaboration.\nFGDs attest to the challenges posed by partnerships, and they also highlighted ways that actors adapted and learned from each other and overcame these challenges. During the baseline study, we found that organizations invested lots of time and deliberate effort in building relationships and trust with their partners. The endline study confirms that this is still valuable time spent.\nSpecifically, grantees enhanced communication by grounding discussions in the shared goals and objectives of the partnership, emphasize collaboration over competition, focus on how the collaboration can support their work (particularly with government partners), and basic open communication (like asking for help when needed and gently pointing out a mistake to be remedied).\nOne Criminal Justice grantee highlighted the role of a steering committee in taking ownership over collaborative work in order to relieve any pressure of an individual organization wanting to own the work alone.\n\n….that steering committee also provided ownership and they know too well that we were not actually engaging for purposes of shaming, but of course we were actually engaging for purposes of deepening, strengthening some of those gaps that we have actually noticed that quickly gave them the level of ownership and confidence. So that particular intelligence steering committee that we set up was actually one of the key success stories that we can actually see … -Criminal Justice FGD participant\n\nA non-grantee organization that works with government used strategic framing for their work to foster trust from their government partners. This was through the use of “knowing and showing” as opposed to “naming and shaming.” This change in perspective allowed the organization to share information with the public about who was responsible for specific public services thereby shining a light on individuals and encouraging proper behavior without causing those individuals to feel they were shamed for any lack of accountability or transparency.\n\n[knowing and showing] gives us an opportunity to sometimes resensitize the actors on the need or what is their responsibility …. they now sit up and so, okay, so it means that the public is aware of what is my statutory responsibility and what I should do. -Non-grantee FGD participant",

And basically we are working with the various programs that we are implementing at XXXX which has to do with the training of high level policy actors in Nigeria. So that’s the focus of our work. –Behavior Change FGD participant\n\nOne grantee each from JoinBodi, Media and Journalism, Behavior Change, and Criminal Justice are building capacity of staff in MDAs or ACAs. This includes grantees like XXXX who are building capacity of gender and inclusion desk officers at XXX to ensure inclusive election processes, XXXX) building fact-checking capabilities at the XXXX, and RFEFED building e-learning platforms for the FEDFE and the XXXX as well as building FREE capacity in asset tracing. XXXXXXXXX also trains policy actors in accountability and integrity.\nThree of the four of the Criminal Justice FGD participants were able to institutionalize some of their initiatives within MDAs, (one is working on an initiative that has potential for institutionalization) along with one Behavior Change grantee. The Criminal Justice grantees have had the most success with developing technological tools the agencies have supported and adopted, while the Behavior Change grantee has been able to institutionalize SME governance standards.

So let me start with the end. The end result is that we now have a Financial Reporting Council issued corporate governance guidelines for SMEs in Nigeria. So now we have a standard for all SME governance in Nigeria.” -Behavior Change grantee\n“We also discovered that all the ACAs, the Anti Corruption agencies needs to have a platform where information can be assessed, where information can be gotten. And we also came up with what we call the web portal for the ACAs. This web portal is a community of practice on information sharing among themselves and it is currently domiciled with the EFCC.” –Criminal Justice grantee\n“So we worked with especially the state anti corruption units in kano, in Oyo state, in Kaduna and in Jigawa to put up what they call the Sharata. The Sharata is a platform, a reporting app where citizens can actually report cases of criminalities and issues that all these anti corruption agencies can go after. And it is it, it tends to keep away the fact that the citizen, if the cases have been reported, they won’t find, they won’t trace the person who is reporting the cases. So it is an open platform for such kind of report cases.” –Criminal Justice grantee\n\nFinding 17. everal grantees highlighted that their initiatives are financially sustainable, and will endure beyond the closure of On Nigeria grant funding.\nXXXXXXX noted that their various platforms (XXXXXXX, XXXXXXXX and YYYYYY) no longer require funding. They allow for ongoing anticorruption dialogue despite grant funding ending. Additionally, XXX was able to work with XXX to incorporate their e-learning platform costs into their budget to ensure that as their grant funding ends the platform can endures for XXX’s training needs.\n\n“In terms of what worked well in terms of our collaboration, the platforms that we are able to establish, especially the three national platforms, which is the XXX, the XXXX and YYYY that were established at both state and national levels, was able to strengthen our grassroots engagement. And these platforms are actually key to our sustainability plan because as we speak, even with the absence of funding, there are still anticorruption discussions that are still going on in these platforms.” –Behavior Change FGD participant",

    "text": "Scale is the extent to which ecosystem actors’ work has been taken up and/or scaled to other geographies and sectors.\n\nFinding 18. Some ecosystem actors are reacting to emerging demand to scale their accountability initiatives, while others designed scaling efforts into their initial projects. There is evidence of grantees’ work being taken to scale in new geographies as well as at higher levels of governance.\nFGD participants highlighted how scaling was intentionally built into their activity designs and a few instances where it occurred organically. Scale was not an explicit focus in the baseline study, but it did highlight that expanding cross-cohort collaboration could be a beneficial step moving forward. The endline study did not find evidence of intentional cross-cohort collaboration.\nFor example, the XXXX published and shared an investigation into the diversion of pension funds in Kano State. Due to the work’s quality and its reach, XXX was approached by other organizations to support and conduct additional investigative reports. XXX was able to scale this service that it offered to clients.\n\n…. But it [the investigative reporting] has led to some other organizations reaching out to us and also reaching out to them….Because initially it started like, okay, why are you investigating us? You don’t like us. But to a level whereby they are now beginning to understand the importance of investigating what they are doing, trying to prove to be accountable.-Media and Journalism FGD participant\n\nSimilarly, the RRRR, a non-grantee, became known for their sensitization work in DFDFD State and was invited to support similar work in DFDFD State.\nA Criminal Justice grantee has had success getting government buy-in on their Transparency and Integrity Index, and now provides advice to other CSOs looking to collaborate with MDAs.\n\nAnd so with this collaboration, especially for the transparency and integrity index, we are already seeing some sister civil society organization. Actually before coming on this meeting, a civil society organization was at the office to say that how do we get government to be part of our programs? How do we even get to use government facilities? You know, the organization is pursuing efforts at looking towards getting the whistleblower bill passed, you know, and so we share ideas and see how we can come up with a program together and all of that. So we already seen some civil society organizations and even a government agency. -Criminal Justice FGD participant\n\nSeveral organizations designed their collaborations to reach broad/national audiences. For example, both DFD and XXX selected their partners for their collaborations to ensure the work would be enacted to scale. XXX partnered with the monitoring and evaluation arm at the RRRR so that their work in constituency project tracking could be conducted across the country rather than in one localized area. EEEE brought their SME governance standards to the OOOOO and the DDDD due to their connection with thousands, and millions, respectively, of SMEs.\n\nBut in our case, we built it with scale in mind, which is why I can be telling you of getting connected to 6 million SMEs. ERERE has 20,000 SME members. So we, we started with scale in mind. We, we partnered with EREERE precisely because of scale. If we look at a bank like XXXX with the thousands of SMEs they have. So each of these partners were carefully selected in order to make sure that the path to scale would be very clear. We’re doing this from an unfair advantage being that we’ve been working on another project since 2012 which had like 14 government agencies and so on. And we’ve seen what it takes actually to get to scale, which is why on this project we could be more deliberate about how we wanted to set up the partnerships. So it was set up with scale in mind from the beginning.—Behavior Change FGD participant\nSo we’re able to ensure that there was a gradual but firm commitment from the grassroots to anti corruption cause. And then we also use the training the trainer approach, which has also helped in expanding the work so that approach helped in mobilizing more people and sending out more of the anti corruption messages where they ordinarily wouldn’t have been able to reach. – Behavior Change FGD participant",

    "title": "Conclusions",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Conclusion 1: Collaboration. Levels of interaction across the accountability ecosystem are largely consistent between the baseline and endline, despite emerging challenges related to civic space in Nigeria. This is due in part to a relatively small time period between the baseline and the endline data collection, and in part to the stability of the On Nigeria activity. As noted in the baseline analysis and confirmed here, robust and effective collaboration involving a number of actors is already present. Based on this analysis this is a positive conclusion and a reflection of the On Nigeria model’s success.\nConclusion 2: Collaboration. On Nigeria’s cohort model appears to function well and to have benefits that reach beyond any of the individual cohorts. As noted especially in the Collaboration subsection of this report, the cohort model provides a strong framework for collaboration. The cohort promotes collaborations among organizations of different types and with different purposes. This makes the cohort a key facilitator of organizational learning and bringing together complementary skills from different organizations.\nThe cohorts facilitated at least quarterly meetings among their membership which helped maintain ongoing, long-term interactions among those members. This helps partners understand how to work with each other which can be among the biggest challenges to a successful partnership.\nThe cohorts’ impact reaches beyond their grantee members because the grantee and non-grantee interactions are extensive which helps promote learning and resource sharing across organizations. FGDs also highlighted the positive awareness of the cohorts by non-grantees. Intentionally engaging non-grantees via the cohorts could help to mobilize more resources for anticorruption efforts in the future.\nConclusion 3: Diversity. The accountability ecosystem spans the country and is made up of a diverse array of organizations, primarily working on the voice side of accountability. The members of the accountability ecosystem work across the country. They are primarily headquarters in the administrative centers of BLUE, YELLOW, and RED where they are also most active. Its actors consist of INGOs, NGOs, MDAs, and private businesses. It is primarily made up NGOs that work on the voice side of the accountability equation. The MDAs on the teeth side are less well represented. The baseline analysis identified the importance of strategically engaging teeth actors to increase their numbers and their involvement across the network. The endline confirms that their numbers did not increase which may hinder how successful voice actors can be if there are not enough willing MDAs to respond to increased demand for accountability.\nConclusion 4: Diversity. Historically marginalized groups play a role in anticorruption but could be more intentionally included. Historically marginalized groups are represented in the accountability ecosystem, and On Nigeria grantees have made efforts to include them in efforts. Additional efforts, such as, ensuring materials are accessible in local languages or that points of view from marginalized groups are included could be valuable. Nonetheless, GESI actors remain rather peripheral in the network with the exception of organizations like SSSSS and ERFD. Efforts to expand their interactions with more actors could see more GESI-infused work and broaden the participation more generally of historically marginalized groups like women, youth, and people with disabilities.\nConclusion 5: Adaptive resilience. Organizational partnerships can be challenging. In overcoming the challenges organizations are iteratively learning from each other and adapting their approaches. Organizations take time and invest effort in building relationships and trust with partners. This was found to be true during the baseline as well as the endline. Existing rivalries, who takes credit for success or takes the blame for failure hinder open collaboration and are issues that exist in the background of even the best partnerships. These pressures also resulted in organizations adapting and finding creative solutions to inter-organizational dynamics. One example was the creation of a steering committee to relieve pressure on any one organization. Another organization shifted the tone of “naming and shaming” to “knowing and showing” to allow them to share information with the public about which MDA was responsible for public services. These examples of adaptation and resilience are small but will have a big impact over time.\nConclusion 6: Institutionalization. Actors in the network are actively working to see that governmental and non-governmental actors have the necessary capacity to ensure accountability work continues past the end of On Nigeria. Grantees highlighted the extent of their training and capacity building of staff at MDAs and ACAs in FGDs. These staff are learning valuable skills to manage systems and use tools to integrate accountabililty into their programs. This work also leads organizations to scale their initiatives either by expanding their geographic reach or by deepening their partnerships with MDAs or ACAs. The examples of successfully institutionalizing systems and digital tools at the EFCC, ICPC, NBA, and the Borno State Judicial System are tangible victories for the accountability ecosystem, and others should learn from their successes to continue these gains.\nConclusion 7: Scale. Ecosystem actors are effectively scaling their successful initiatives. In some cases this scaling happen vertically and in others it happens horizontally. Successful anticorruption initiatives are being scaled. FGD participants provided examples of this happening organically as well as through intentional design. Initiatives have been scaled to different states to widen the reach of successful efforts, as highlighted by the scaling of a transparency and integrity index that is being brought to additional MDAs. Intentionally designing and planning for scale has proven successful when partnering with an MDA to track nationwide initiatives, for example.",

    "text": "Centrality Statistics\nGlobal centrality statistics help understand each node’s place in the overall network and whether or not they are connected to many or few other nodes in the network. Knowing this information helps to determine if an organization may be more or less influential than other organizations in the network.\nFour commonly used centrality statistics are Betweenness Centrality, Closeness, Eigenvector Centrality, and Degree Centrality (overall, out, and in).\nBetweenness centrality measures the extent to which an organization is connected to other network actors that are not connected to each other. Nodes with high betweenness serve as bridges between different parts of a network.\nCloseness calculates the average distance between a node and all other nodes in a network. It is used to identify nodes that reach other nodes quickly. In disconnected networks, it may be necessary to use Harmonic Centrality instead.\nEigenvector Centrality is a measure of the influence of a node in a network. Those nodes that are connected to other well-connected nodes will have high eigenvector centrality scores.\nDegree Centrality is a count of the number of connections of each node. In directed networks it can have both an in-degree and an out-degree score. The out-degree score denotes the number of connections the node initiates, and the in-degree score denotes the number of connections the node receives. The overall degree score is the sum of the in-degree and the out-degree scores.\nAdditionally, a network’s density is a useful statistic to understand, but it is hard to put in context. The calculation is the number of connections divided by the total possible number of connections. A network density of 1 means that all nodes are connected to each other. This is common in small, friend group networks, but less common in real-world networks. It would not make sense for a network to be perfectly dense, and optimal density is hard to define.
